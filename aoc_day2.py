"""A program to analyze sequences of numbers for safety based on adjacent number differences.
This module reads sequences of numbers from a file and determines if they are 'safe' or 'unsafe'
based on whether the difference between adjacent numbers is within Â±3 and the numbers are not equal.
Functions:
    read_file_lines(filename: str) -> list:
        Reads the input file and returns processed lines as integers.
    convert_to_int(lines: list) -> list:
        Converts each line from the input into a list of integers.
    convert_toint(line: str) -> tuple:
        Converts a single line into integers and checks for safety.
    is_line_safe(line_ints: list) -> tuple:
        Determines if a sequence of integers is safe based on adjacent differences.
        A sequence is safe if all adjacent numbers differ by no more than 3 and are not equal.
    print_results(results: str) -> None:
        Prints the final results of the safety analysis.
    main() -> tuple:
        Main entry point that processes the input file and returns safety statistics.
Global Variables:
    safe (int): Counter for safe sequences
    unsafe (int): Counter for unsafe sequences
File Dependencies:
    aoc_day2.txt: Input file containing sequences of numbers to analyze
Returns:
    tuple: Contains counts of safe and unsafe sequences (safe1, safe, unsafe1, unsafe)
