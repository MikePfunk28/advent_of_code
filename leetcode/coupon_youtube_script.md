# ðŸŽ¯ 3 Ways to Validate Coupons in Python - YouTube Short Script

## Hook (0-3 seconds)
**"Three different ways to solve the SAME coding problem! Which one would YOU choose?"**

## Method 1: The Manual Approach (3-15 seconds)
**"Method 1 - Going OLD SCHOOL!"**
- Line 11: Create a sorting dictionary - electronics=0, grocery=1, pharmacy=2, restaurant=3
- Line 14: ZIP the three arrays together - code, business type, and active status
- Line 15: Triple check - must be ACTIVE, must EXIST, must be VALID business type
- Line 18: The character validator - ANY bad character? Skip it!
- Line 20: Store as tuple with sort priority
- Line 21: Python sorts automatically - business first, then alphabetical

## Method 2: The Regex Ninja (15-27 seconds)
**"Method 2 - REGEX to the rescue!"**
- Line 39: Compile the pattern ONCE - performance boost!
- Line 42: Single condition chain - cleaner code, same result
- fullmatch() validates the ENTIRE string
- One line does what took us multiple lines before

## Method 3: The Helper Function Hero (27-40 seconds)
**"Method 3 - Clean and readable!"**
- Line 54: Helper function 'goods' - does ONE thing well
- Line 57: Manual character loop with early return
- Separates validation logic from main algorithm
- Most readable for beginners

## The Payoff (40-45 seconds)
**"Same output, three approaches! Manual loops vs regex vs helper functions - which is YOUR style?"**

## Call to Action (45-50 seconds)
**"Drop your favorite method in the comments! Follow for more Python tricks!"**

## Visual Cues for Editing:
- Show code snippets for each method
- Highlight the key lines as you explain them
- Show the output: ["PHARMA5", "SAVE20"]
- Quick transitions between methods
- Use arrows/zoom effects on important lines

## Background Music:
Upbeat tech/coding music, keep it energetic but not overwhelming

## Text Overlays:
- "Method 1: Manual"
- "Method 2: Regex"
- "Method 3: Helper Function"
- Performance comparison if possible

## Pro Tips for Maximum Engagement:
1. **Start with a question** - gets people thinking
2. **Use numbers** - "3 ways" creates structure
3. **Show the code** - visual learners love seeing syntax
4. **Compare performance** - developers love optimization
5. **End with interaction** - comments drive engagement
