# Coupon Validation - Line by Line Script

Three ways to solve coupon validation - here's exactly how each line works.

Line 11 - I create a dictionary mapping business types to sort order. Electronics gets 0, grocery gets 1, pharmacy 2, restaurant 3.

Line 14 - Zip combines three lists element by element. So I get each coupon code, its business type, and whether it's active all at once.

Line 15 - Triple condition check. Must be active AND code exists AND business type is valid. If any fail, continue skips to next iteration.

Line 18 - Here's the magic. Any() with generator expression checks every character. If ANY character is not alphanumeric or underscore, we skip this coupon. Short-circuits on first bad character.

Line 20 - Append a tuple with sort order number and the code. This sets us up for easy sorting.

Line 21 - Sort by tuple. First element is business priority, second is alphabetical. Python handles this automatically.

Solution 2 line 39 - Compile regex pattern once. Caret means start of string, dollar means end. Plus means one or more characters.

Line 42 - Single condition chain. All checks in one if statement using fullmatch to validate entire string.

Solution 3 line 54 - Helper function goods. Early return False for empty strings saves processing.

Line 57 - Manual character loop. Check each character individually, return False if invalid.

Same logic, three implementations. Manual loops, regex patterns, or helper functions.
